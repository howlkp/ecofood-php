Food Bank For New York City has been working to end food poverty in our five boroughs for over 35 years. As the city’s largest hunger-relief organization, we employ a multifaceted approach centered on helping low-income New Yorkers overcome their circumstances and achieve greater independence.

		<p><strong>1 out of every 5 New Yorkers relies on a soup kitchen or pantry for dinner.

1 out of every 4 NYC children is at risk of experiencing hunger.

1 out of every 5 NYC seniors requires help from a charity to feed themselves.</strong><br>

In order to properly serve the 1.5 million New Yorkers relying on Food Bank, help must come from different corners of compassion and leadership. Food donations are vital to our ability to enable soup kitchens and pantries with the resources needed to serve our city’s most vulnerable. Whether your business is in the food industry or not, whether you plan to make a difference solo or as a member of a team, there’s a New Yorker who needs you, and many ways for you to serve.</p></div>
